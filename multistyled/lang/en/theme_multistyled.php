Base is part of the Moodle core, but you will need to ensure you have multilayout installed as well (The multilayout theme should have been included in the zip file that this theme was downloaded in and may have been installed to your server at the same time). The theme has been designed to work in browsers from <strong>IE7+ and including FF, Chrome and Safari</strong> - it has also been developed to work with <strong>rtl language layouts</strong>.<br/><br/>The theme allows any one of <strong>5 different layouts</strong> (3column - holygrail/blogstyle, 2 column - left or right sidebars, 1column full width) to be applied either site wide through the setting spage or by duplicating the main general_layout.php file and setting the chosen layout in the code there - these new files can then be referenced from the config.php for different page types as needed. The layouts also have additional block regions above and below the main content region for even greater flexibility.<br/><br/>The settings page for multistyled also gives a selection of <strong>pre-set colour schemes and styles</strong> (such as rounded corners) which can be applied to the theme - alternatively the theme can be styled in detail using the custom css box.';
